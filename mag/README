Contact-programmed ROM cells for sky130
---------------------------------------

Every circuit layout in this repository has been hand drawn so that all
conb_1 cells are oriented in the same direction.  For each bit, the
cell is programmed by default to zero (LO) and can be changed to one
(HI) by moving the "mcon" contact from the right side to the left side
by 0.69um, or 138 internal units.  All contacts are listed in the .mag layout
file in order from left to right.  This is the order of bits low to high
except for the 32 bit project I.D., which alternates bits between bottom
and top.  The low bit is on the bottom left of the layout, and the high
bit is on the top right.

For example:  To program bit 0 (low bit) of the product I.D. to value "1",
change the 1st mcon entry in the file "product_id_rom_8bit.mag" from

	rect 557 765 591 799
to
	rect 419 765 453 799

(subtracting 138 from the 1st and 3rd values, which are the lower X
value and the upper X value, respectively).

Warning:  The .mag files in this directory are hand-edited and cannot
be produced directly from magic, because normally in a .mag file, the
contact and the metal underneath it are mutually exclusive, so moving
the contact will create a hole in the metal.

To create a non-default programmed ROM, the cell should be copied to
a new file with a value-specific cell name, the contact positions
changed, and then the cell can be used in a layout to produce GDS
output.
